Baby Care is an application developed as part of the three-month
Unicoding bootcamp, designed to provide a one-stop solution for
all the needs of children. With a user-friendly interface and
intuitive features, Baby Care includes a pediatrician section that
allows parents to connect with qualified medical professionals and
seek advice and guidance on any health-related concerns they
may have. This section enables parents to make appointments
and access important medical records in a secure and convenient way.
